- add a combobox for multiple pebbles
- 


- solved a bug in polish translation															-> OK

- Bugs in voice output trainer:
	- on duration settings page there is a error message if multiple empty fields are selected	-> OK
	- empty fields where not left out. Instead they were played sometimes						-> OK

- Implement shoe management for running
- STRAVA:
	- "Meine Strava AktivitÃ¤ten" not working, not showing anything on the page
	- in Strava settings there is nothing shown in username, Email, Country

Do not forget:
- set changelog and release date to .changes file

----- ToDo for second next release to openrepos: 1.0.2 -----
- when loading autosave and while not resuming workout in recordpage, the duration gets smaller
- show battery state of phone with charging icon on record page
- sometimes the mediaplayer would not set playing to false. Need a watchdog for that.
- add max pace to detailspage/trackloader
- meerun imports have no max. speed
- look into old map tiles folder and delete files there. Ask user!
- map on record page: zoom into map automatically. Save and restore last zoom setting.
- pebble: if speed is choosen for third field, set unit to speed. Same with pace.
- add new feature: autopause if speed goes below certain threshold
- start page: select pace/speed
- add icons for indicating over/below average speed, average pace and average heart rate to record page
- add leading 0 to values on recordpage




----- Other planned features for the far future: -----
- add min/max elevation to detailspage/trackloader
- fix elevation up/down bad values. This is a big thing. Elevation data needs to be corrected with appropriate algorithms.
- check if speedoverground in QGeoPositionInfo is eventually better then own speed calculation -> seems to contain no information
- implement workout comparison. Compare current workout with virtual workout in the past
- AM/PM mode for recordpage
- support all workout types from meerun (is not possible because export function in meerun is broken for many workout types, even on android)
- introduce reward system:
	- fastest run 5/10/20/40 km
	- longest run (distance/time)
	- most workouts in a week/month
	- most distance in a week/month
	- most time in a week/month
	-  5km in under 30/25/20/15 mins
	- 10km in under 1h/55/50/48/45/40/35/30 mins
- view burned calories on mainpage and recordpage and detailspage
- bluetooth data logging function (writing to files does not work???)
- introduce female voice
- alert system:
	- vibration alert / sound alert
	- send vibration also to pebble via dbus call provided by rockpool (does not exist. Have to do this myself?)
	- make sound file configurable or changeable
- record page workover, add more data to view
		- current, minimum, maximum height (gps)
		- up/down travelled height
		- energy kcal
		- average speed/tempo 
		- speed/tempo of last 100m/1km
		- top speed/tempo
		- average, minimum, maximum heart rate 
		- pause time
- save pause time to gpx file. Look in Meerun gpx file where to save pause data.
- Style first page list view like in meerun (upper part of page should not scroll)
- enable night mode automatically. 
- view diagrams on the statistics page. See app "Rush Hour" and "SystemDataScope" which are on openrepos.
- make volume of audio messages adjustable
- Messagebox needs to be extended. If a page is locked to portrait mode, messagebox needs also be locked to this mode.
- check if bluetooth is active. If not, switch it on. (see file ActionDisableBluetooth.qml in app slumber-master, or rockpool.qml)
- support workouts without gps e.g. indoor activities
- introduce lap function
- CRC check for Zephyr HxM data packets
- BLE heart rate devices support (currently waiting for kimmoli to bring this to OPX)


Bugs:

- there are strange files in the ~/Laufhelden folder, e.g. "running-Di. Nov. 7 16:00:36 2017-7.5km.gpx.wZ8116" or "running-Mi. Nov. 8 15:46:48 2017-0.5km.gpx.M27425"
- sometimes there is a view problem on mainpage after a completed workout.
- if HRM is active and record page is left and then opened again, we get a BT error.
- after bt scan and finding new HRM device, not able to connect. First need to restart app.
- compiler issue, comparison between signed and unsigned
- write to log file is not working, strange no error or something...

- there is a problem with umlauts in the filenames while loading GPX files.
	- HistoryModel::loadAccelerationFile:402 - File not existant:  "running-Fr. M?rz 16 19:38:57 2018-11.7km.gpx"
	- seems to only occure when app is started directly by Sailfish OS IDE. If app is started from desktop launcher all is OK.
- add workout icon on details page							-> OK
- make the app start faster by scanning the GPX files directory and comparing that to a database		-> OK
	- App start:
		- load acceleration file, parse to array and check consistecy with GPX files -> gpxFilesChanged: loadAccelerationFile()
		- check if there are more GPX files and add those files to the m_trackList array: readDirectory()
		- go through trackList array and load all GPX files which have ready==false: loadAllTracks();
		- there may be changes in GPX files which is given by variable gpxFilesChanged, so: saveAccelerationFile() is always entered after loadAllTracks()
	- Remove workout:
		- remove GPX file from directory
		- if GXP was removed successfully: remove track from m_trackList array
		- if GXP was removed successfully: set variable gpxFilesChanged to true and: saveAccelerationFile() 
	- Edit workout:
		- set ready flag to false in m_trackList array by index and gpxFilesChanged to true: editTrack(index)
		- go through all tracks and load that one with ready==false:  loadAllTracks()
		- set variable gpxFilesChanged to true and: saveAccelerationFile()
	- Add workout:
		- in mainpage in block if (bLoadHistoryData), scan for new GPX files and add them to m_trackList: readDirectory()
		- set variable gpxFilesChanged to true and: saveAccelerationFile()	
	- bug in consistency checking, wrong date format: "Sat Jan 20 20:39:23 2018" / "Sa. Jan. 20 20:39:23 2018"		-> OK
